The following summarizes Prof. Fravel's rationale for the course assignments.

In-class Exam
-------------

The exam seeks to test the student's knowledge of the material presented in the readings as well as lectures. The exam will include two components:

1.  Identifications: the student will be a given a list of terms from the sources, such as the names of important people, places, events or concepts. For each answer, be sure to a) define or describe the term and b) state why it is important in the context of the course or its significance for key events in the international relations of East Asia. Students should write 3 to 4 succinct sentences and be as specific as possible to demonstrate their knowledge of the term.
2.  Short-answer questions: the student will be given a list of questions, drawing on material presented in the course. Students should write 6 to 8 sentences for each answer.

Quizzes
-------

The quizzes seek to ensure that all students have completed, digested and understood the required readings. Students are given four questions and required to answer three in 15 minutes. In their answers, students should demonstrate a mastery of the assigned readings.

Take-home Exercise
------------------

This is an open book exercise where the student answers one question over a defined period of time. The question is designed to give the student an opportunity to synthesize material from the entire course. No additional research is required or expected â€“ all of the necessary materials are included in the assigned readings and lectures. The exercise must be no more 3,000 words. Students must include a word count at the top of their paper. Essays longer than 3,000 words will be penalized.
